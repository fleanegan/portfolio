<h1 class="title">Creating Lamps</h1>
<div class="description">
    My passion for crafting lamps dates back to my school days when I saw Olafur Eliasson’s artwork “Red emotional
    globe” in an exhibition. I was so awestruck that I went straight home and started building a replica to have it
    always near. After this initiation, I dared to work on own creations. Since having a fully fledged workshop is not
    compatible with a student's lifestyle, I learned quickly adapting my ideas in order to bring them to life with limited
    resources. My works heavily rely on repurposing available materials and products - the base frames of the hexagonal
    lamp for example are built from sanitary pipes and wooden baseboards. Furthermore I make use of simple manufacturing
    techniques such as soldering.
