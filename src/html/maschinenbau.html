    <div class="description">
        I studied mechanical engineering at the University TU Dresden in Germany.
        During the studies I discovered my interest for programming
        and steadily specialised in the direction of industry 4.0.
        On this page you can find my master thesis which is about force control
        for an industrial machine. The developed software solution enables
        the machine to "feel" obstacles and follow their contours by deviating from the programmed path.
        Below you see how the planned circle turned into a kidney shape in order to maintain contact with the followed
        objects surface.

        in German)
