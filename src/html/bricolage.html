    <div class="description">
        My passion for crafting lamps dates back to my school days when I saw Olafur Eliasson’s artwork “Red emotional
        globe” in an exhibition. I was so awestruck that I went straight home and started building a replica to have it
        always near. After this initiation, I dared to work on own creations. Since having a fully fledged workshop is
        not
        compatible with a student's lifestyle, I learned quickly adapting my ideas in order to bring them to life with
        limited
        resources. My works heavily rely on repurposing available materials and products - the base frames of the
        hexagonal
        lamp for example are built from sanitary pipes and wooden baseboards. Furthermore I make use of simple
        manufacturing
        techniques such as soldering.
